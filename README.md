This is a little IOT implementation of a broker, in this case, RabbitMQ.

Create a descentralized system where multiple IoT send tasks (eg. updates, image analysis) to a group of workers that process them.

## Technologies:
  - RabbitMQ, working queues.
  - Npm RabbitMQ-client, producers and cosumers.
  - Docker Compose, arrange the containers.
  - Api with ExpessJS (night discard).
  - Simulated IoT component, code.

## Arrangement:
-> -> ->

It should... `tbr`
